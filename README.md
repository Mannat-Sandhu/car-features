# Analyzing the impact of car features on price and profitability
#### Using Microsoft Excel

## About the Project
The dataset contains information on various car models and their specifications, and is titled "Car Features and MSRP". 
It was collected and made available on Kaggle by Cooper Union, a private college located in New York City.

## Tools Used
- Microsoft Excel - Data Analysis
- Microsoft Excel - Dashboard

## Project Tasks
- How does the popularity of a car model vary across different market categories?
- What is the relationship between a car's engine power and its price?
- Which car features are most important in determining a car's price?
- How does the average price of a car vary across different manufacturers?
- What is the relationship between fuel efficiency and the number of cylinders in a car's engine?

## Results
- **Task 1:** average popularity of a car doesn’t depends upon count of model across different market categories as crossover, flex fuel, performance have highest average popularity but count of models is just 6.
- **Task 2:** there is a linear relationship between engine power and price as power increases the price also increases.
- **Task 3:** the most important feature determining car’s price is  no of engine cylinders in a car.
- **Task 4:** the average price for Bugatti is highest.
- **Task 5:** inverse linear relationship between fuel efficiency and number of cylinders in a car; as no of cylinders increases the fuel efficiency decreases.
